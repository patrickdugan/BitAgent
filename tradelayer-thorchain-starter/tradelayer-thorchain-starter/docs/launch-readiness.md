# BitAgent Launch Readiness

Report date: 2026-07-23

Deployment:
`https://bitagent-launch-kernel.duganist875063.chatgpt.site`, owner-only,
version 3, source commit `e2ced291b2e4cf4457aebb5b907c9c0facca4d02`.

## Decision

**Scripted launch demo: ready. Production funds: not ready.**

The narrow referral-to-deposit-to-strategy-to-withdraw journey is complete and
observable in a deterministic testnet demo. Production execution remains
fail-closed, so no known issue in this build can broadcast or lose real funds.
The missing authenticated wallet broker and live verification providers are
release blockers for funded use.

## Passed checks

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| End-to-end trajectories | 24/24 passed |
| Focused agent cases | 50/50 passed |
| Local launch test process | 27/27 tests passed |
| Hosted Worker/D1 tests | 2/2 passed |
| Intent, tool, argument, approval, truth, completion, recovery, and secret-safety scores | 1.00 each |
| Root TypeScript check | Passed |
| NEAR chain-abstraction focused cases | 8/8 passed |
| Official 1Click token discovery and live dry quote | Passed |
| Hardhat compile | Passed |
| Hardhat mock-contract test | 1/1 passed |
| Hosted vinext build | Passed |
| Hosted ESLint | Passed |
| Deployed page and generated social metadata | HTTP 200, passed |
| Deployed D1 strategy and withdrawal journey | Verified through durable resume |
| Recent production Worker errors after version 2 | None |
| Referral activation before verified strategy | Prevented |
| Execution without exact approval | Prevented |
| Stale simulation execution | Prevented |
| Secret-key requests or persistence | Prevented |
| Interrupted-session resume | Passed |
| Duplicate execution | Idempotent |
| Malformed withdrawal address | Rejected |

The end-to-end suite covers normal completion, cancellation, insufficient
funds, malformed addresses and txids, unconfirmed deposits, rejected wallet
approval, stale quotes, pending-verification retry, duplicate execution,
referral timing, prohibited secret material, unsupported scope, and recovery
after simulation, approval, and submission.

Machine-readable evidence:

- `eval/artifacts/agent-evaluation-latest.json`
- `eval/artifacts/failure-traces.jsonl`
- `eval/fixtures/failure-traces.seed.jsonl`

## Remaining release blockers

1. **Wallet authority and ownership.** There is no authenticated public-session
   API in the local wallet that issues and consumes an opaque approval token.
   The hosted demo workflow IDs are unowned demo identifiers, not production
   authorization.
2. **Live Bitcoin intake.** The launch UI uses a deterministic confirmed UTXO
   event. A production chain source must prove address ownership, outpoint,
   value, network, block height, confirmation count, and reorg handling.
3. **Live strategy quote/configuration.** The quote, property IDs, order
   minimums, and fee policy are scripted. They must come from live,
   operator-approved TradeLayer configuration.
4. **Safe wallet execution.** The local wallet and `tradelayer.js` precedents
   expose WIF/internal-signing paths that BitAgent must not call. A wallet-owned
   PSBT/order signer and broadcaster is required.
5. **Independent verification.** Production needs stable Bitcoin transaction,
   TradeLayer order/position, fill, balance, and withdrawal confirmation
   queries. Provider results, not the language model, must drive state.
6. **NEAR origin-wallet execution.** The live 1Click quote/status adapter is
   present, but a funded route still needs an authenticated wallet-owned EVM
   or NEAR broker plus a destination outpoint observer. Preview/stale quotes
   and unapproved execution already fail closed.
7. **Operational controls.** Production requires access control, rate limits,
   audit retention, provider health checks, network/market allowlists,
   observability, backup/restore drills, and incident recovery.

## Known limitations

- The strategy is always one post-only tlBTC-for-tlUSD type-5 order.
- The demo wallet and transaction evidence are scripted and labeled.
- The hosted UI accepts Bitcoin testnet addresses only.
- The local JSON store is suitable for one demo process, not multi-instance
  production.
- D1 and local state implement equivalent stages but do not yet share one
  generated schema package.
- DLC/VTXO is a typed follow-on seam only and is not a supported intent.
- ETH/USDC-to-native-BTC onboarding defaults to NEAR Intents. The hosted
  referral UI still demonstrates direct scripted Bitcoin intake and does not
  fund a live 1Click address.
- THORChain is a legacy opt-in adapter only.
- The installed `chainsig.js` runtime has broken strict declarations for
  unrelated chain modules, so it is isolated behind a local typed boundary.
- `npm audit --omit=dev` reports 16 production-tree advisories: 3 high,
  5 moderate, and 8 low, with no critical advisory. The high findings are
  transitive `axios`/`form-data`/`ws` paths pulled through the official SDK
  dependency trees. Funded release requires upgrading or isolating those
  transports after upstream fixes.

## Committed algorithmic signals (2026-07-26)

The new committed-signal lane is **ready for scripted Bitcoin testnet4
evaluation and not ready for funded execution**.

Passed:

- 26/26 focused end-to-end and adversarial signal cases;
- reproducible eight-dimension signal evaluation report with sanitized
  training traces;
- exact clean-Git or source-tree codebase pinning plus Ed25519 producer
  authentication;
- source mutation detection at execution time;
- strict signal schema, canonical signal hash, expiry, and strategy allowlist;
- confirmed UTXO selection through the real UTXO-Ref V2 funding-root builder;
- real TradeLayer tx5 payload encoding for post-only TLBTC/TLUSD buy/sell;
- wallet balance, exposure, drawdown, order, notional, and fee caps;
- exact wallet approval binding, cancellation/rejection recovery, idempotent
  execution, independent verification state, UTXO conflict prevention, and
  atomic interrupted-session resume;
- secret-bearing signal fields rejected and opaque approval tokens redacted.

Funded execution remains blocked on an authenticated wallet-owned
`SignalExecutionBroker` with live UTXO/TradeLayer truth, exact PSBT approval,
keyless signing/broadcast, and independent order/position verification. The
legacy algorithm folder is hashed as provenance only and is never executed by
BitAgent.

## Exit criteria for funded launch

Funded launch may proceed only after all seven blockers above are implemented
and rerun against a real testnet wallet, Bitcoin observer, TradeLayer
submission path, and independent verifier. Add adversarial wallet-session
ownership tests and at least one real rejected-signature and interrupted-submit
recovery drill. Then repeat the full suite with production mode enabled and no
scripted broker in the dependency graph.
